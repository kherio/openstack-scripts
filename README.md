# Welcome to the OpenStack Install Scripts project on GitHub

This project aims to covert the steps in the OpenStack Install guide into useful/simple scripts. The goal is not to provide a _perfect_ automation solution. But the idea is to have simple building blocks which can help developers and enthusiasts experiment with OpenStack in a much simpler fashion.

#### Platform supported - Ubuntu server 17.04 and 16.04
#### OpenStack version - Pike

#### Prerequisites ####
_git_ binaries must be installed on your Ubuntu server. This is needed to checkout the scripts to your Ubuntu server. 

If you are using VirtualBox, refer to this blog for Network settings - http://goo.gl/VTJVmv

#### OpenStack services installed ####
The following OpenStack services are installed as part these scripts:

1. Keystone (Identity)
2. Glance (Image)
3. Nova (Compute)
4. Neutron (Networking)
5. Horizon (Dashboard)

#### Important Notes ####
1. The script installs Linux Bridge packages by default. Installing OVS can be done using a utility script provided in the `lib` directory.
2. Many scripts detect the OpenStack Node Type automatically using `util/detect-nodetype.sh` script.
3. The node type controller includes network node capabilities. This is new behavior in OpenStack since Liberty release.
4. VXLAN is the default tenant network type used.
5. In Pike, as in Ocata, Nova has default support for Cells. To add compute nodes for scheduling you may need to execute `nova-manage cell_v2 discover_hosts --verbose` command on the controller.

## How to use the scripts step by step ##

1. Edit the lib/config-parameters.sh file
   - Important: Make sure that Management and Data plane interface names are accurate. 
   - Optional: Change the hostname to be used for controller. This name will be used in all configuration files. 
   - Optional: Change passwords as necessary 

2. Install OpenStack packages depending upon the type of the node
   - If the node is of type controller, execute `sudo bash install.sh controller`
   - If the node is of type compute, execute `sudo bash install.sh compute`

3. Configure OpenStack packages using `sudo bash configure.sh <controller_ip_address>`. The **node type** is detected automatically.

4. Post Config Actions can be triggered using `sudo bash post-config-actions.sh` script on the controller node only. This interactive script does the following:
   - New in Newton/Ocata: create Flavors for instances. **Newton/Ocata does not ship with any default Flavors**
   - Enables web browser based view of Nova and Neutron log files.
   - Downloads and creates a Cirros Glance Image for booting up VMs.
   - Creates two OpenStack networks and their subnets


## Useful scripts - Updating IP Address ##

If there is a change in the IP address of the controller, then use the `util/update-ip.sh` script to ensure that all config settings are updated. This command needs to be run on controller as well as the compute nodes.

Usage: `sudo bash util/update-ip.sh <management-interface-name> <controller-host-name> <controller-ip>`. 
The second and third parameter is used for network nodes and compute nodes.

## Removing OpenStack packages ##

You can remove all the OpenStack packages using `sudo bash remove.sh`. The **node type** is detected automatically and the corresponding packages are removed.

## Restarting OpenStack services ##

Restarting OpenStack services is needed at times - especially when config file entries are changed. You can execute `sudo bash manage-services.sh` to do this. The **node type** is detected automatically.

## Updating /etc/hosts file ##

Since all configuration uses the name of the controller host, it is important to update `/etc/hosts` file on all the node to map an IP address to the controller host name. You can use the `util/update-etc-hosts.sh` script for this purpose.
